# VHDLRouter
This was Done as a Group Project for CSE 312 - Electronic Design Automation [Fall 2020]

# About The Project: 
The aim of this project is to design, implement and test a simple router using VHDL. The project main concern is the design of a synthesisable VHDL code for the router and its testbench. <br/>
It is a Structural implementation: First implementation of several Modules and then combining them altogether.<br/>

The Modules are: 
* 8-bit register
* DeMux
* Dual Port Block RAM 
* Gray Counter
* Gray to Binary Converter
* FIFO controller
* FIFO
* Round Robin Schedular
* Router
* Router Testbench
